            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 3, 2026</p>

        <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Notify - Meeting Reminders's policy to respect your privacy regarding
            any
            information we
            may collect from you across our application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Notify - Meeting Reminders is designed to be privacy-first. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your
            personal
            data to
            our servers.</p>

        <h3>Calendar Data and Google API Services User Data Policy</h3>
        <p>Notify - Meeting Reminders requests access to your calendar solely to display your upcoming events and
            provide reminders
            within
            the app. This data is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read directly from your device's local calendar store (EventKit) or fetched directly via
                <strong>official Google and Microsoft APIs</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Processed entirely <strong>locally on your Mac</strong>.</li>
            <li>Never uploaded to any external server or cloud service by us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use):</strong> Notify - Meeting Reminders's use and
            transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API
                Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not use or transfer your data for serving ads, including retargeting, personalized, or
                interest-based advertising.</li>
            <li>We do not allow humans to read your data unless we have your affirmative agreement for specific
                messages, doing so is necessary for security purposes such as investigating abuse, to comply with
                applicable law, or for the app's internal operations and the data (including derivations) have been
                aggregated and anonymized.</li>
            <li>We do not transfer or sell your data to third parties like advertising platforms, data brokers, or any
                information resellers.</li>
            <li>We do not use or transfer your data to train generalized/non-personalized machine learning (ML) or
                artificial intelligence (AI) models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Storage and Protection</h2>
        <p>All app preferences (like theme, refresh interval, and enabled calendars) are stored locally on your device
            using standard macOS user defaults.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Your calendar data fetched from Google Workspace APIs is processed locally
            and protected using industry-standard encryption. All communication with Google APIs occurs exclusively over
            secure, encrypted HTTPS (TLS) connections to protect your sensitive data in transit. We do not collect,
            store, or transmit any OAuth tokens to our servers; they are kept securely in your local macOS Keychain,
            leveraging strong, native OS-level encryption.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong> Notify - Meeting Reminders is a local-only macOS application. We do not
            retain, store, or log any of your Google user data on any external servers. Your calendar events are
            temporarily cached locally on your device solely for the duration necessary to display them in the app.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You have full control over your data. To delete your locally cached Google
            user data and revoke access, simply disconnect your Google account within the app's settings. Doing so will
            immediately and permanently delete the OAuth tokens from your macOS Keychain and wipe all associated cached
            calendar events from your device. You may also uninstall the app to clear all local data entirely.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking services, or advertising SDKs. The app functions entirely
            offline (except for syncing your calendars with iCloud/Google/etc., which is handled by macOS system
            services, or through direct, secure API connections by Notify - Meeting Reminders).</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via our <a
                href="https://github.com/pramodbhn/notify-app/issues">GitHub Issues</a> page.</p>
